        <title>Jumping In!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome to my brand new website! And with it, I introduce my blog! I will use this blog to describe some of the cool stuff that I’ve been working on. I’ll try to focus on web development, graphics and image processing. It will help serve as tutorials to those starting out in these areas, as well as my own personal guide that I document along the way. I hope you find it entertaining as well as instructional. Stay tuned!&lt;/p&gt;
